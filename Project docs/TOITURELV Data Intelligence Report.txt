Growth Insights
The Good:
* Sustained hypergrowth from startup phase (2020) to scale (2025)
* Average quote value increasing 149% ($9,200 → $22,900)
* Quote volume increased 7.5x (249 → 2,088/year)
* 2025 margins improving significantly (38% Q1 vs 25% historical)
The Concern:
* 2024 showed slowdown (+5% vs +48% prior year)
* 2025 rebound may be driven by larger project mix, not volume

	🔍 Notable Pattern: Client 165
Client 165 appears to be a property management company:
* 65 quotes over 5 years (most of any customer)
* 45 different projects across 38 buildings
* $1.53M lifetime value
* Average $23,598 per quote
This is a strategic relationship that should be protected and nurtured.
❓ QUESTION FOR LAURENT: Can you confirm Client 165 is a property manager? Who is this customer and what's the relationship status? Are there other property management relationships we should identify?

Inspection has 46.8% margins - nearly double the company average. Currently only $0.4M revenue.
Recommendation: Upsell inspection services with every quote.
If 10% of customers add a $500 inspection:
* 830 inspections × $500 × 46.8% margin = $194K additional profit

Data Quality Issues & Red Flags
🚨 Critical Issue #1: 2022 Labor Data Anomaly
Problem: 2022 shows median labor hours of 1.3 hours per job vs normal 20-30 hours
Year
	Median Labor Hours
	Status
	2020
	26.0 hrs
	✅ Normal
	2021
	24.5 hrs
	✅ Normal
	2022
	1.3 hrs
	❌ ANOMALOUS
	2023
	22.0 hrs
	✅ Normal
	2024
	20.0 hrs
	✅ Normal
	2025
	18.5 hrs
	✅ Normal
	Impact:
* Cannot use 2022 labor data for Cortex training
* 1,512 quotes (~18%) have unreliable labor hours
* Skews historical trend analysis
❓ QUESTION FOR LAURENT: What happened in 2022? Was there a change in how labor was entered in C-Cube? A system migration? Different person doing data entry?


🚨 Critical Issue #2: "Other" Category Opacity
Problem: "Other" category contains $48.5M (40.8% of revenue) with no further classification.
Impact:
* Can't analyze what's driving largest revenue segment
* Algorithm accuracy limited for undefined job types
* Strategic decisions may miss key business drivers
❓ QUESTION FOR LAURENT: What types of jobs are in "Other"? Can we get C-Cube to break this down further? Is this a catch-all category or specific job types?
⚠️ Issue #3: Square Footage Coverage Gap
Current State: Only 33% of quotes have square footage recorded
Impact:
* Limits $/sqft analysis accuracy
* Cortex algorithm has smaller training set
* Can't benchmark across all categories
Recommendation: Implement mandatory sqft field in C-Cube for all new quotes.
⚠️ Issue #4: Buildings with Multiple Client IDs
Finding: 127 buildings appear under multiple client IDs
Possible Explanations:
* Property ownership changes
* Different contacts at same property
* Data entry variations
❓ QUESTION FOR LAURENT: Do you track when properties change ownership? Are these legitimate different customers or data quality issues?
