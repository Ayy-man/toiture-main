The Cortex: AI-Powered Estimation System for TOITURELV
Your Brain, Automated
________________


Executive Summary
Laurent approves 50 quotes per week, consuming 5+ hours of his most valuable time. This is TOITURELV’s biggest bottleneck.
Generic AI tools suggest $75/hour rates when you charge $120/hour. They don’t know your business, your pricing, or your 11,000 past jobs.
The Cortex is different. It’s trained exclusively on your data:
* 11,000 quotes with your actual pricing

* 300 hours of your client calls

* Years of your emails and invoices

* Your decision-making patterns

Unlike other AI agents (slow, inaccurate, generic), The Cortex combines lightning-fast algorithms with intelligent reasoning to replicate how you estimate — but in seconds instead of minutes.
Expected Outcome: Reduce quote approval time by 80% (from 5 hours to 1 hour weekly), freeing 16 hours monthly = $8,000+ in value.

The Problem: Why Generic AI Failed You
You’ve tested AI estimation tools before. They were:
   * ❌ Too slow (10–30 seconds)

   * ❌ Too generic (suggesting $75/hr when you charge $120/hr)

   * ❌ Too basic (can’t handle complex scenarios)

   * ❌ No context (don’t know Montreal vs Laval pricing differences)

The real issue: generic AI doesn’t know your business.

The Solution: The Cortex System
Priority #1: The Cortex (Internal AI Estimation Assistant)
A hybrid intelligent system combining algorithmic speed with deep AI reasoning.
Fast Track (90% of quotes):
      * Instant pricing using patterns from your 11 000 historical quotes

      * Response time < 1 second

      * Variables: size, material, pitch, location, season, access

      * Knows your actual costs and margins ($120/hr, not $75/hr)

AI Override (Complex cases):
         * Vector search finds similar past jobs in your database

         * Claude AI analyzes differences and provides reasoning

         * Response time 3–5 seconds

         * Handles unusual configurations, special materials, unique site conditions

Self-Learning Loop:
            * Tracks when AI overrides algorithm decisions

            * Continuously improves accuracy from real approvals

            * Your team gets smarter quotes every week

How Your Team Uses It:
               * Slack bot: “Quote 1500 sqft asphalt shingle, 6/12 pitch, Laval”

               * Web dashboard: input specs → instant quote + reasoning

               * Direct C-Cube integration: auto-suggest pricing as quotes are built

Training Data Sources:
                  * ✅ 11 000 quotes (materials, labor, pricing patterns)

                  * ✅ 300 hours of call recordings

                  * ✅ 3–4 years of emails

                  * ✅ Invoice history (actual vs quoted)

                  * ✅ Laurent’s recorded decision-making process
